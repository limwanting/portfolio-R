title: "About me"
---

Welcome to my space! I currently work in Singtel as a Digital Project Manager with a strong focus on analytics initiatives. I completed a MicroMasters from Georgia Tech in August 2020 and am using it as advanced standing for the university's Masters in Business Analytics starting in Spring 2021.

Before I pivoted into data and analytics, I was a chemical engineer. After I graduated with my Bachelors in Chemical Engineering from the National University of Singapore in May 2014, I had a stint in public service as an engineer in a water treatment plant till 2018.

I love working on various projects and research, constantly learning and challenging myself. In my free time, I am either cooped up at home with a good book or at the volleyball court.

I would love to hear from you - reach out to me at limwanting1991@gmail.com!
