Welcome to my space! I currently work in ...

I am currently pursuing my Masters in Business Analytics at ...

Before I pivoted into data and analytics, I was a chemical engineer, graduating with my Bachelors in Chemical Engineering from the National University of Singapore in May 2014 and had a short stint in public service as an engineer till 2018.

I love working on various projects and research, constantly learning and challenging myself. In my free time, I am either cooped up at home with a good book or up in the air on aerial silks.
